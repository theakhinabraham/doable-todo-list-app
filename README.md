<h2>Staying up-to-date with original code: </h2>

1. You have to shift to `main` branch first but do **NOT** `push` to `main` branch

```
git checkout main
```
<br>

2. Perform a `pull` to stay updated. It must show `Already up-to-date`

```
git pull
```
<br>

3. Now you have to shift back to your branch `my-user-name` again before you can continue editing code

```
git checkout my-user-name
```
<br>

4. Perform a `pull` again in `my-user-name` your own branch

```
git pull
```
<br>

<h2>Once you are ready to push the changes, follow these steps: </h2>

1. Confirm you are in `my-user-name` your own branch

```
git branch
```
<br>

2. Push the changes

```
git add .
git commit -m "issue #24 fixed"
```
<br>

3. Choose `git push origin HEAD`, do **NOT** choose `git push origin HEAD:master`

```
git push
git push origin HEAD
```
