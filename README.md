2. Perform a `pull` to stay updated. It must show `Already up-to-date`

```
git pull

```
git checkout my-user-name
```
<br>

4. Perform a `pull` again in `my-user-name` your own branch

```
git pull
```
<br>

<h2>Once you are ready to push the changes, follow these steps: </h2>

1. Confirm you are in `my-user-name` your own branch

```
git branch
```
<br>

2. Push the changes

```
git add .
git commit -m "issue #24 fixed"
